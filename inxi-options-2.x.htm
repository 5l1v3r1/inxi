<h1>inxi (2.x.x) options:</h1>
<pre>
Page Version: 3.1
Page Updated: 2018-02-24
inxi version: 2.3.56
</pre>
<p>NOTE: these options are for inxi 2.xx.xx. If you are looking for the new Perl inxi options, go to <a href="/docs/inxi-options.htm">inxi 3.xx.xx and later options</a>. The following are the supported options of inxi.</p>
<pre>inxi supports the following options. You can combine them, or list them one
by one. Examples: inxi -v4 -c6 OR inxi -bDc 6. If you start inxi with no
arguments, it will show the short form.
 
The following options if used without -F, -b, or -v will show just option
line(s): A, B, C, D, G, I, M, N, P, R, S, f, i, m, n, o, p, l, u, r, s, t -
you can use these alone or together to show just the line(s) you want to see.
If you use them with -v [level], -b or -F, it will show the full output for
that line along with the output for the chosen verbosity level.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Output Control Options:
-A     Audio/sound card information.
-b     Basic output, short form. Like inxi -v 2, only minus hard disk names .
-B     Battery info, shows charge, condition, plus extra information (if
       battery present).
-c     Color schemes. Scheme number is required. Color selectors run a color
       selector option prior to inxi starting which lets you set the config
       file value for the selection.
       Supported color schemes: 0-42 Example: inxi -c 11
       Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: irc and global only show
       safe color set):
         94  Console, out of X
         95  Terminal, running in X - like xTerm
         96  Gui IRC, running in X - like Xchat, Quassel, Konversation etc.
         97  Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm
         98  Console IRC not in  X
         99  Global - Overrides/removes all settings. Setting specific removes
             global. 
-C     CPU output, including per CPU clockspeed and max CPU speed (if
       available). 
-d     Optical drive data (and floppy disks, if present). Same as -Dd. See
       also -x and -xx.
-D     Full hard Disk info, not only model, ie: /dev/sda ST380817AS 80.0GB.
       See also -x and -xx. Disk total used percentage includes swap partition
       size(s). 
-f     All cpu flags, triggers -C. Not shown with -F to avoid spamming. ARM
       cpus show 'features'.
-F     Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters, plus -s and
       -n. Does not show extra verbose options like -d -f -l -m -o -p -r -t -u
       -x 
-G     Graphic card information (card, display server type/version,
       resolution, renderer, OpenGL version).
-i     Wan IP address, and shows local interfaces (requires ifconfig network
       tool). Same as -Nni. Not shown with -F for user security reasons, you
       shouldn't paste your local/wan IP.
-I     Information: processes, uptime, memory, irc client (or shell type),
       inxi version.
-l     Partition labels. Default: short partition -P. For full -p output, use:
       -pl (or -plu).
-m     Memory (RAM) data. Physical system memory array(s), capacity, how many
       devices (slots) supported, and individual memory devices (sticks of
       memory etc). For devices, shows device locator, size, speed, type
       (like: DDR3). If neither -I nor -tm are selected, also shows ram
       used/total. Also see -x, -xx, -xxx
-M     Machine data. Device type (desktop, server, laptop, VM etc.),
       Motherboard, Bios, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo). Shows
       UEFI/BIOS/UEFI [Legacy]. Older systems/kernels without the required
       /sys data can use dmidecode instead, run as root. Dmidecode can be
       forced with -! 33
-n     Advanced Network card information. Same as -Nn. Shows interface, speed,
       mac id, state, etc.
-N     Network card information. With -x, shows PCI BusID, Port number.
-o     Unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).

       Example: <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file  
-p     Full partition information (-P plus all other detected partitions).
-P     Basic partition information (shows what -v 4 would show, but without
       extra data). Shows, if detected: / /boot /home /opt /tmp /usr /var
       /var/log /var/tmp . Use -p to see all mounted partitions.

       extra data with -x/-xx. md-raid: If device is resyncing, shows resync
       progress line as well.
-s     Sensors output (if sensors installed/configured): mobo/cpu/gpu temp;
       detected fan speeds. Gpu temp only for Fglrx/Nvidia drivers. Nvidia
       shows screen number for > 1 screens.
-S     System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X),
       distro 
-t     Processes. Requires extra options: c (cpu) m (memory) cm (cpu+memory).
       If followed by numbers 1-20, shows that number of processes for each
       type (default: 5; if in irc, max: 5): -t cm10
       Make sure to have no space between letters and numbers (-t cm10 -
       right, -t cm 10 - wrong).

Debugging Options:
-%     Overrides defective or corrupted data.
-@     Triggers debugger output. Requires debugging level 1-14 (8-10 - logging

         9   Full file/sys info logging
         10  Color logging.
       The following create a tar.gz file of system data, plus collecting the

       to ftp.techpatterns.com: inxi -xx@ <11-14>
       For alternate ftp upload locations:

         13  With data from dev, disks, partitions, etc., plus /sys tree
             traverse data file.
         14  Everything, full data collection.
 
Advanced Options:
-! 31  Turns off hostname in output. Useful if showing output from servers etc.
-! 32  Turns on hostname in output. Overrides global B_SHOW_HOST='false'
-! 33  Forces use of dmidecode data instead of /sys where relevant (-M).
-! 34  Skips SSL certificate checks for all downloader activies
       (wget/fetch/curl only). Must go before other options.
-! 40  Will try to get display data out of X. Default gets it from display :0.
       If you use this format: -! 40:1 it would get it from display 1 instead,
       or any display you specify as long as there is no space between -! 40
       and the :[display-number].
-! 41  Bypass curl as a downloader option.
-! 42  Bypass fetch as a downloader option.
-! 43  Bypass wget as a downloader option.
-! 44  Bypass curl, fetch, and wget as a downloader options. Forces Perl if
       HTTP::Tiny present.
