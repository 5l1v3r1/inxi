<h1>inxi :: dependencies and recommended programs</h1>
<pre>
Page Version: 1.0.0
Page Last Updated: 2015-08-24

<ul>
<li><a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a> &#8211; the programs inxi requires to run</li>
<li><a href="#recommends">Recommends</a> &#8211; programs that some parts of inxi require for full output, but which are not required to run inxi</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Dependencies are programs that are required for inxi to run.</p>
<p>Package names in (...) are the Debian Squeeze package name. Check your distro for proper package name by doing this: which -application- then find what package owns that application file. </p>
<p>Please check the inxi top comment header for the latest Depends/Recommends listing, it should always be up to date, unlike this wiki page. </p>
<p>Note that all graphics packages previously labeled Depends have been made Recommends because inxi should be able to run on headless or X-less systems, as a system utility. Distro maintainers can decide what they want to do with the X utilities, if it&#x27;s possible to test if X packages are installed, and if so, install these Recommends as Dependencies, that would be ideal. </p>
<p>As of version 1.6.6, you can run the start option <b>inxi --recommends</b> which will print out all dependencies and recommends, along with some other information, then tell you which package you need to install to add that feature. </p>
<ul>
<li>bash &gt;=3.0 (bash) </li>
<li>df, readlink, stty, tr, uname, wc (coreutils) </li>
<li>gawk (gawk) </li>
<li>grep (grep) </li>
<li>lspci (pciutils) </li>
<li>free, ps, uptime (procps) </li><li>sed (sed) </li>
</ul>
<h3>/proc and /sys</h3>
<p><strong>Linux only</strong>: The following are not programs per se, but are things that are also required for inxi to run properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The proc filesystem should be present and mounted.</li>
<li>It is useful to have the /sys filesystem because inxi can get a lot of system hardware data from there without requiring root user. /sys is is used to collect a variety of system data, especially for -M and -d. </li>
</ul>
<h3>General issues with Bash</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apparently unpatched bash 3.0 has arrays broken; bug reports: </li>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-3.0-patches/bash30-008">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-3.0-patches/bash30-008</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2004-08/msg00144.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2004-08/msg00144.html</a> </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arrays work in bash 2.05b, but &quot;egrep -m&quot; does not.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recommends">Recommends</h2>

<p>Recommends are programs that are required to run certain specific features of inxi, but are not required to run inxi itself. We always strive to keep recommends to a bare minimum, to make inxi as portable and flexible as possible.</p>

<p>Package names in (...) are the Debian Squeeze package name. Check your distro for proper package name by doing this: which -application- then find what package owns that application file. </p>
<p>Please check the inxi top comment header for the latest Depends/Recommends listing, it should always be up to date, unlike this wiki page. </p>
<p>Note that all graphics packages previously labeled Depends have been made Recommends because inxi should be able to run on headless or X-less systems, as a system utility. Distro maintainers can decide what they want to do with the X utilities, if it&#x27;s possible to test if X packages are installed, and if so, install these Recommends as Dependencies, that would be ideal. </p>
<p>As of version 1.6.6, you can run the start option --recommends which will print out all dependencies and recommends, along with some other information, then tell you which package you need to install to add that feature. </p>

<ul>
<li>-A, -N - for output of usb audio/network card information: lsusb (usbutils) </li><li>-Ax - for audio module version: modinfo (module-init-tools) </li>
<li>-Dx - for hdd temp output (root only default): hddtemp (hddtemp) </li>
<li>-S - for detecting running desktop: xprop (X11-utils) </li>
<li>-D - For user level hdd temp output: sudo (sudo)<br>
* Note: requires user action for this feature to run as user (edit /etc/sudoers file)</li>
<li>-G - full graphics output requires:
	<ul>
	<li>glxinfo (mesa-utils) </li>
	<li>xdpyinfo (x11-utils) </li>
	<li>xrandr (x11-xserver-utils) </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>-i - IP information, local/wan - ip (iproute) (previous to 1.7.8, inxi used the deprecated tool: ifconfig (net-tools). Please note that so as to not break previous inxi installs, inxi still will use ifconfig if ip is missing, so you won&#x27;t see any unexpected errors.</li>
<li>-I (out of X) or -Ix (in X) - view current runlevel: runlevel (sysvinit). Not applicable for new systemd systems.</li>
<li>-o - for unmounted file system information in unmounted drives (root only default): file (file)<br>
* Note: requires user action for this feature to run as user (edit /etc/sudoers file)<br>
* For user level unmounted file system type output: sudo (sudo)</li>
<li>-s   For any sensors output, fan, temp, etc: sensors (lm-sensors)<br>
* Note: requires setup of lm-sensors (sensors-detect and adding modules/modprobe/reboot,
and ideally, pwmconfig) prior to full output being available. </li>
</ul>
